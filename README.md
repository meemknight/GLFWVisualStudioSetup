# Plug And Play GLFW VisualStudio setup

## What is it?

---

I already configured a Visual Studio solution with everything that you need to start learning OpenGL!
I even added GLM, Imgui with extensions, and stb_image for you!

## How to use?

If you just want to learn OpenGL from the https://learnopengl.com/ you can just delete the content from main.cpp and start from scratch!
*BUT* re-add ```#include <openglErrorReporting.h>``` and the ```enableReportGlErrors();``` line!!!!!!!!

They are very important because they will enable OpenGL error reporting for you!!!!!!!!! And trust me you want that!

Other than that this is a normal visual studio solution, enjoy!

If you want other templates that use CMake, check out this video:
